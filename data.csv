question,answer
"What is included in this Machine Learning course?","This course covers the full ML pipeline: Python programming, Data Preprocessing, Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning with TensorFlow, and Model Deployment."
"How long does the course take to complete?","The course is designed to be completed in 12 weeks if you study 10 hours per week. However, you have lifetime access to the materials."
"What are the prerequisites?","You need a basic understanding of Python and high-school level mathematics (Linear Algebra and Probability). We provide a refresher module for both."
"Do you offer a certificate?","Yes, upon completing the capstone project, you will receive an industry-recognized Machine Learning Engineer certificate."
"What tools and libraries will we use?","We primarily use Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and TensorFlow/Keras for Deep Learning."
"Is there job placement support?","Yes, we offer resume reviews, mock technical interviews, and access to our hiring partner network."
"What is the difference between AI, ML, and Deep Learning?","AI is the broad science of mimicking human abilities. Machine Learning is a subset of AI that learns from data. Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers."
"What is Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning?","Supervised Learning uses labeled data (input-output pairs) to train models (e.g., Spam Detection). Unsupervised Learning finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., Customer Segmentation)."
"Explain Overfitting and Underfitting.","Overfitting happens when a model learns the training noise and fails on new data (High Variance). Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern (High Bias)."
"What is the Bias-Variance Tradeoff?","It is the balance between two errors. Bias is the error from erroneous assumptions (too simple). Variance is the error from sensitivity to small fluctuations (too complex). The goal is to minimize both."
"What is the difference between Precision and Recall?","Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives (Quality). Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class (Quantity)."
"What is Cross-Validation?","It is a technique to evaluate model performance by splitting data into 'k' subsets. The model is trained on k-1 subsets and tested on the remaining one, repeated k times to ensure robustness."
"What is Regularization (L1 vs L2)?","Regularization prevents overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function. L1 (Lasso) shrinks coefficients to zero (feature selection). L2 (Ridge) shrinks coefficients evenly but not to zero."
"How do you handle missing data?","You can drop rows/columns (if data is huge), impute with mean/median/mode, use Forward/Backward fill (time-series), or use algorithms like KNN Imputation."
"What is the difference between Bagging and Boosting?","Bagging (e.g., Random Forest) builds independent models in parallel and averages them to reduce variance. Boosting (e.g., XGBoost) builds models sequentially, where each new model corrects the errors of the previous one."
"Explain the ROC Curve and AUC.","ROC is a probability curve plotting True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate. AUC (Area Under Curve) represents the degree of separability; higher AUC means the model is better at distinguishing classes."
"What is the Vanishing Gradient Problem?","In deep neural networks, gradients used to update weights can become extremely small during backpropagation, causing the early layers to stop learning. Solutions include using ReLU activation or ResNets."
"What is the difference between Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Batch Gradient Descent?","Batch GD uses the entire dataset to compute the gradient (slow, stable). SGD uses a single sample per step (fast, noisy). Mini-batch GD is a compromise using small batches."
"How do you deal with an Imbalanced Dataset?","Techniques include: Resampling (Oversampling minority class / Undersampling majority class), using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), or changing metrics from Accuracy to F1-Score."
"What is a Confusion Matrix?","A table used to evaluate classification models. It shows True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives (Type I error), and False Negatives (Type II error)."
"What is Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?","PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique. It transforms correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables (principal components) while retaining as much variance (information) as possible."
"What is the role of an Activation Function?","It introduces non-linearity into the neural network, allowing it to learn complex patterns. Common functions include Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and Softmax."
"What is Transfer Learning?","It is a technique where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It saves time and computational resources (e.g., using BERT for NLP tasks)."
"Explain the concept of 'One-Hot Encoding'.","It converts categorical variables into a binary matrix format. For example, 'Red, Green, Blue' becomes [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1]. It is necessary because ML models require numerical input."
"What is the difference between K-Means and KNN?","K-Means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that groups data into K clusters. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) is a supervised classification/regression algorithm that predicts based on the closest data points."
"What is the Transformer architecture?","The Transformer is a deep learning architecture introduced in the 'Attention Is All You Need' paper. It relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data, discarding the recurrent logic of RNNs, allowing for parallelization."
"Explain the concept of 'Attention' in Deep Learning.","Attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence differently. For example, in translation, when predicting the word 'eating', the model focuses more on 'apple' than 'the'."
"What is the difference between BERT and GPT?","BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is an encoder-only model designed for understanding context (good for classification). GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a decoder-only model designed for generating text."
"What is Tokenization?","Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens (words, subwords, or characters) which are then converted into numerical vectors for the model to process."
"What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?","RAG is a technique that combines a frozen LLM with an external knowledge retrieval system. It allows the LLM to answer questions using private or up-to-date data without needing retraining."
"What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?","A CNN is a deep learning algorithm designed for processing grid-like data (images). It uses convolutional layers to automatically detect spatial hierarchies of features like edges, textures, and shapes."
"What is the purpose of Max Pooling?","Max Pooling reduces the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the input volume for the next convolutional layer. It reduces computation and helps the model learn translation-invariant features."
"What is Data Augmentation in Computer Vision?","It is a technique to increase the diversity of training data by applying random transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, and color shifting to existing images to prevent overfitting."
"What is YOLO (You Only Look Once)?","YOLO is a real-time object detection algorithm. Unlike other models that run a classifier on many parts of an image, YOLO treats detection as a single regression problem, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities in one go."
"What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)?","CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger, regardless of the population's original distribution."
"What is a P-Value?","The P-value is the probability of observing test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. A P-value < 0.05 usually leads to rejecting the null hypothesis."
"What is A/B Testing?","A/B testing is a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B. It is used to compare two versions of a webpage or app feature to determine which one performs better based on a statistical metric."
"What is the difference between Type I and Type II errors?","Type I error (False Positive) is rejecting a true null hypothesis (convicting an innocent person). Type II error (False Negative) is failing to reject a false null hypothesis (letting a guilty person go free)."
"What is the difference between SQL WHERE and HAVING clauses?","WHERE filters rows before grouping (cannot be used with aggregate functions). HAVING filters groups after the aggregation has been applied."
"What is Normalization vs Standardization?","Normalization (Min-Max Scaling) scales data to a range of [0,1]. Standardization (Z-score scaling) transforms data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1."
"What is a Lambda Function in Python?","A lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. Example: `lambda x: x * 2`."
"What are Python Decorators?","Decorators are a way to modify the behavior of a function or class without changing its source code. They are usually defined with the `@` symbol before the function definition."
"What is the difference between List and Tuple in Python?","Lists are mutable (can be changed) and use square brackets `[]`. Tuples are immutable (cannot be changed) and use parentheses `()`. Tuples are faster and used for fixed data."
"Explain the concept of 'Gradient Descent'.","Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function. It iteratively moves towards the steepest descent (negative gradient) to find the optimal weights for the model."
"What is LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)?","LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for LLMs. Instead of updating all weights, it injects trainable low-rank matrices into the model, drastically reducing the memory needed for training."
"What is the difference between Batch and Layer Normalization?","Batch Norm normalizes across the batch dimension (good for CNNs). Layer Norm normalizes across the feature dimension for a single sample (good for RNNs and Transformers)."
"What is F1-Score and when should you use it?","The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. You should use it when you have an imbalanced dataset and need to balance the trade-off between precision and recall."
"What is a Random Seed?","A random seed is a number used to initialize a pseudorandom number generator. Setting a seed ensures that your train/test splits and model initialization are reproducible."
"What is Docker and why is it used in ML?","Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. In ML, it ensures that the model runs exactly the same way in production as it did on your local machine."
"What is CI/CD for Machine Learning (CT/CD)?","It stands for Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment. In ML, this often includes Continuous Training (CT), where the pipeline automatically retrains and deploys models when new data arrives."
